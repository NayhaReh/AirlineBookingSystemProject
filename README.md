# Airline Booking System ✈️

A command-line flight reservation system developed in **C/C++**, designed to simulate core airline booking operations including reservations, cancellations, seat allocation, and passenger record management.

This project demonstrates **systems programming**, **file-based data persistence**, and **modular software design**.


## 🚀 Features

- Flight booking and cancellation  
- Passenger record management  
- Seat allocation and availability tracking  
- Search and retrieval of booking information  
- Input validation for reliable transactions  
- Persistent data storage using file I/O  

---

## 🧠 System Design

The system is structured using **modular and object-oriented principles** to separate:

- Booking logic  
- Passenger data handling  
- File storage operations  
- User interaction (CLI interface)

Data is stored using **file-based persistence**, allowing bookings and passenger information to be saved and reloaded across program runs.
